Further more by default it will dynamically discover the list of available mirrors by querying a DNS entry and extrapolating from that data. It does not attempt to use any sort of method of securing this querying of the DNS like DNSSEC. Software packages are downloaded over these insecure links, unpacked, and then typically the setup.py python file inside of them is executed.",
